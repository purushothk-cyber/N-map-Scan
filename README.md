**Open Port Scanner – Local Network Security Check**

**Overview:**
This project demonstrates how to scan devices on your local network to discover open ports, helping users understand network exposure and basic cybersecurity practices.

It uses tools like nmap to identify:
Devices connected to the same Wi-Fi/network
Open ports and the services running on them
Potential vulnerabilities caused by unnecessary open ports

**Objective**

To learn how to:
Detect devices on your local network
Scan devices for open ports
Analyze the services running on those ports
Understand basic network security exposure

**Tools Used**
Tool	Purpose
Nmap	Network and port scanning
arp	Discovering devices on the local network
ping	Checking if devices are online
netstat	(Optional) View open ports on your machine

Note:** All tools used are command-line, available on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL or PowerShell alternatives).
**
**Files Included**
Local Scan-Nmap.xml – Nmap scan report of local network

**Key Concepts**
Port scanning & TCP SYN scan
Network reconnaissance
Identifying open/filtered ports
Understanding service exposure and risks

**Outcome**
By completing this task, I gained:
Practical skills in using nmap for scanning networks
Awareness of how exposed services could lead to vulnerabilities
A foundational understanding of how attackers map networks
